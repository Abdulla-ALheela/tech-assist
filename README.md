# Tech-Assist  ðŸ’»

**TechAssist** is a user-friendly app designed to streamline IT support requests. It allows users to create, edit, view, and delete requests, ensuring a smooth and efficient communication process with the Admins. When a user submits a new request, they can assign it to the Admins, who can then provide updates on the status of the request in real-time.
